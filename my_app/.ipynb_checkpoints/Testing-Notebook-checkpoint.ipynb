       "array(['tsu, japan   bank of japan board member sayuri shirai ruled out the chance of an imminent expansion of monetary stimulus, but warned of risks to the price outlook that may put pressure on the central bank as it seeks to hit an ambitious inflation target. shirai, a former imf economist who is more pessimistic about price prospects than some others in the board, said a broad uptrend in inflation was taking hold, and steady improvements in the economy would help lift wages and consumer prices. but she warned that wage rises have been modest and companies may be slow in raising prices of their goods if underlying inflation remained subdued for too long. \"if downside risks materialise and significantly weaken the underlying trend in inflation, i would not hesitate to consider some monetary policy actions,\" shirai told business leaders in tsu, a city in the western prefecture of mie, on wednesday. \"at present, however, i view such a possibility to be low.\" the boj has stood pat on policy since expanding its massive stimulus programme in october last year to prevent slumping oil costs, and a subsequent slowdown in inflation, from delaying a sustained end to deflation. it pushed back the timing for hitting its price target in april and now says inflation will reach 2 percent in the first half of next fiscal year beginning in april 2016. many analysts see the new timeframe as too ambitious with consumer inflation hovering around zero due to the lower cost of oil and soft private consumption. shirai said inflation will accelerate moderately as household and corporate spending recover from the pain of last year\\'s sales tax hike. but she said disappointingly weak inflation expectations have prevented price rises from accelerating as much as the boj hoped. companies may continue to hold off on raising prices if inflation remained subdued, she added. \"if a deviation of actual inflation and the boj\\'s price target is sustained, the public and markets may begin to believe that achieving the target would be difficult,\" she said. \"this may make it harder for medium- to long-term inflation expectations to rise further and steadily.\" shirai is among those in the board who feel it will take longer than the boj\\'s consensus forecast to hit 2 percent inflation. in april, she proposed setting the timing for hitting the target \"at or around fiscal 2016,\" which would give the boj until early 2017 in meeting the price goal. the proposal was turned down by the board.

       "       'los angeles   authorities in california, where the death penalty has been on hold since 2006, have reached a court settlement that would require the state to create lethal injection rules that could allow it to resume executions, officials said on tuesday. attorneys for the most populous u.s. state submitted the settlement to a sacramento court on monday in a lawsuit brought by family members of murder victims who say the state\\'s failure to provide a viable execution method denies them justice. the agreement comes ahead of a u.s. supreme court ruling expected this month in a case brought by oklahoma death row inmates challenging that state\\'s executions by lethal injection as a violation of the u.s. constitution\\'s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. the outcome of that case, in which their lawyers argue the sedative midazolam cannot achieve the level of unconsciousness required for surgery, could determine whether certain drugs in lethal injection are constitutional. california prison officials, represented by the office of democratic attorney general kamala harris, pledged under their settlement to release proposed regulations for a resumption of lethal injection within 120 days of the supreme court decision. the state has 749 inmates on death row and has not carried out an execution since 2006 when a federal judge found problems with its three-drug cocktail for lethal injection. officials tried to fix those deficiencies, but a state judge in 2011 deemed the process a failure. under the latest settlement, prison officials plan to propose a single-drug protocol for executions, said deborah hoffman, spokeswoman for the state department of corrections and rehabilitation. last year, another federal judge, in a ruling that applied to only one inmate plaintiff, found california\\'s system for imposing and carrying out the death penalty was so long and drawn-out it amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. the california settlement follows moves by other states to end the death penalty, with nebraska this year becoming the 19th state to do so, according to the death penalty information center. ana zamora, a policy director for the american civil liberties union of northern california, which has fought the death penalty, said california\\'s death penalty system was broken. \"any effort to change the execution procedures is doomed to fail and guaranteed to bring more legal challenges, more delays and cost more money,\" zamora said. in 2012, a california ballot measure to abolish the death penalty lost narrowly.

       "       '(reuters) - organizers of the 2022 world cup in qatar have indicated they will not relinquish the right to host soccer\\'s showpiece event easily, whatever the fall-out from sepp blatter\\'s decision to step down as fifa president. blatter, who counted the nations of the arabian gulf among his strongest allies, rocked the world of soccer on tuesday by unexpectedly saying he would step down as fifa president in the wake of a corruption investigation. no sooner had the swiss announced his decision than english football association chairman greg dyke raised the possibility that the controversial vote that awarded qatar the tournament could be re-run. \"if i was the qatari organizers i wouldn\\'t sleep very well tonight,\" the former tv executive told british media. \"i think if the evidence comes out which shows the bidding processes were above board that\\'s fine. if it shows they were corrupt then obviously the bids should be re-done, it\\'s as simple as that.\" sheikh hamad bin khalifa bin ahmed al-thani, president of the qatar football association, hit back immediately. \"mr dyke\\'s instinct to immediately focus on stripping qatar of the world cup speaks volumes on his views concerning what will be the first fifa world cup to take place in the middle east,\" he said in a statement. \"we would urge mr dyke to let the legal process take its course and concentrate on delivering his promise to build an england team capable of winning the 2022 fifa world cup in qatar.\" qatar beat australia, japan, the united states and south korea to win the right to host the tournament, but the ballot has been dogged by allegations of corruption ever since. the summary of an internal fifa investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 world cups, released in 2014, cleared the qatar bid of wrongdoing. former u.s. attorney michael garcia, who conducted the probe, later resigned, however, and said the summary contained \"numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations\" of facts and conclusions in his report. the swiss attorney general announced its own probe into the bidding processes after local police arrested several fifa officials in zurich last week. as well as the corruption allegations, qatar has had to wage a public relations battle over why a country with little soccer history and where summer temperatures regularly top 40 degrees celsius (104 f) should host the tournament. \"qatar was never understandable - to have a world cup in the middle of summer in qatar when even fifa\\'s health and safety people advised not to do it,\" dyke added on tuesday. qatar organizers have consistently denied all allegations of  corruption and al-thani said they would continue to cooperate with investigations into the bidding process. \"having already cooperated fully with mr. garcia\\'s investigation --- and been subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing --- we welcome the office of the swiss attorney general conducting its own work into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 world cups,\" his statement added.
