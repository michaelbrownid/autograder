# autograder
Autograder for handwritten free-response answers using ML.



### Motivation

Hand-grading free-response questions is a daunting task for many teachers. Current technology allows for autograding of multiple-choice questions (e.g., Illuminate has built-in scoring and gradebook update capabilities). However, OCR-based handwriting recognition is not yet readily available to the public. This tool aims to alleviate the grading burden for teachers.


### Inspiration

Microsoft has very strong on-the-fly penstroke capturing software, Windows Ink. However, this technology is proprietary. I aim to create a lighter-weight, opensource tool with similar functionality.
